# react-ecommerce-prototype

A prototype of what could be a real-world eCommerce application built with :heart: with React JS!

## Installation

The backend only does one thing at the moment -- process Stripe payment

run `yarn install` then `yarn start` from the root directory. That will run the backend app on port 5000

### Run Client App

1. `$ cd client/` terminal goes to client directory
2. `$ yarn install` installs dependencies
3. `$ yarn start` starts the client app on port 3000
